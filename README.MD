# Overview
I’ve been working on a plugin for ArcDPS using its realtime combat api. The plugin shows a realtime list of failed mechanics for players. The mechanics are determined by the skill id of the attack a player/npc is hit by. It shows a timestamp in ‘min:sec’ since entering combat and ‘X was hit by Y mechanic’.

This plugin is not intended to breed toxicity, but instead help show players mechanical areas where the players can improve. This is in the same way that arcdps shows how dps/boons could be improved.

Here are some example screenshots (with names redacted):

If you have any ideas for things I’m missing, please let me know.

I have no current interest in mechanics detection for PvP / WvW. I’m not even sure what kind of things would be useful to show from those game modes. I don’t PvP / WvW much myself.

# Installation:

This requires a recent version of arcdps . When in doubt, get the latest from here.

Put the .dll file in the same folder as arcdps (Program Files/Guild Wars 2/bin64 by default).

To disable, just remove the .dll or move it to a different folder.

This plugin shouldn’t need to be updated with Guild Wars 2 updates, but arcdps must be compatible with Guild Wars 2.

If arcdps updates the combat api, this plugin might need to be updated for compatibility.

# Usage:

Don’t be a dick.

Open the arcdps options panel (Alt+Shift+T by default) and enable the “Mechanics Log” or “Mechanics Chart” checkboxes at the bottom

or use the hotkeys Alt+Shift+L (Log) / Alt+Shift+N (Chart)

# Troubleshooting:

Be sure you’re running the latest version of arcdps.

Ensure directx9 june2010 runtime is installed (needed for arcdps and this plugin)

Ensure visual c 2013 x64 redist is installed (needed for arcdps and this plugin)

Ensure the .dll file is in the “bin64″ folder, not the “bin” folder

Right click on the .dll file -> go to properties. If there is an “Unblock” button, click that button and apply changes

If options are not being saved, manually create a file named “arcdps_mechanics.ini” next to the arcdps.ini (Default file location is “C:\Program Files\Guild Wars 2\addons\arcdps\arcdps_mechanics.ini”)

# Notes:

If an attack is successfully blocked, evaded, or invulned, then it is not listed.

Attacks that interrupt (Gorseval slams, Samarog slaps, etc) are not listed if the player has stability.

The combat api has a small delay (~2 seconds) before the mechanic will be shown.

All the combat data used by this plugin are in the arcdps .evtc log files anyway. This simply parses it in realtime.

Some of the mechanics are not necessarily bad. Getting a bomb on sloth is normal, but if the bomb is then dropped in a bad place, you can see who had it.

Vapor Form / Illusion of Life do not count as 2nd downs in the chart

# Reading the Chart:

A “neutral” mechanic is a mechanic that a player might have to deal with during the fight. This isn’t bad, but it might lower that player’s personal DPS to do the mechanic (e.g. Matthias corruption, Dhuum shackles, etc)

A “failed” mechanic is a negative mechanic that a player was hit by (e.g. Vale Guardian teleports, expanding a Deimos oil, etc)

Some mechanics are not necessarily the hit player’s fault. If 1 sub-group gets slammed on Gorseval, that might be the chrono’s fault (depending on the group’s strategy).

# FAQ:

Q: Is it Terms of Service compliant?

A: Yes. I’ve talked to Chris Cleary from Anet and he did not see any issues with compliance. ([part1](https://i.imgur.com/hwAe5L9.png) [part2](https://i.imgur.com/pnLhxQd.png))

# Known Issues:

If a player has a magnetic aura, reflecting distortion, etc and reflects a shard on Matthias, it will say the player with the buff reflected and not the player that granted the buff.

The chart will track downs/deaths of players in open-world PvE / WvW squads. This can get spammy. For now, I recommend clearing the chart before starting instanced content to avoid the clutter.

Send bug reports, feedback, hate mail, etc to ‘MarsEdge’ on reddit or ‘MarsEdge.8241’ (ingame)

            MAMA
                was hit by wirl -> was hit by whirl
            Feedback on these or any other wording changes is welcome. One of my goals has been to be sure that when someone looks at the log they can quickly understand what they were hit by.
        Add check to be sure the chart csv export path isn’t empty
        Add additional checks for if a player id is 0
            (fixes a rare case where lagging players might get missing/malformed combat data)

        Update for arcdps event structure changes
        Change “ate shockwave” to “was shockwaved” in log
    October 1 2018
        Add tracking for some wing 6 mechanics

            2 = log only
            3 = both
        Change window names to title case to match the experimental arcdps naming conventions
    September 11 2018
        Add tracking for
            WARNING: These require arcdps from September 10 2018 or newer. This is the ‘experimental’ arcdps build at the time of this posting. Using an older arcdps build will work, but the below mechanics will be missing from the output
            When someone GETS the Xera magic, instead of when the magic is used
            Xera teleports
            Deimos teleports
            FotM flux bombs
            Dhuum putrid marks (chart only)
        Fix some mechanics not being detected if a player gets multiple mechanics in a very short time frame
        Fix closing a Deimos tear being counted as a ‘Fail’
        Fix cairn slaps being improperly detected when a player has stability
        Improved Deimos oil tracking
            This should be more robust now. It’s not gonna be 100% accurate for extremely chaotic situations, but it should be easy to know who’s responsible from the output
        Rename “Received” mechanics to “Neutral” mechanics
    July 16 2018
        Remove KC east/west fixate tracking
            Unfortunately, the KC changes make the east and west sides now use the same id. As such, they are no longer distinguishable. 🙁
    July 10 2018
        Fix mysterious issue where some computers couldn’t load the .dll file
    July 10 2018
        MAJOR rewrite of almost all of the internal tracking

            Separate detection for KC east vs west fixate
                Special thanks to [Meta] Dungeon Ducks for inspiring the addition of this mechanic
                This was working before KC was broken. This might no longer be accurate/possible. I’ll fix this once KC is confirmed to be stable
                Hopefully they still have separate ids for the different sides
        Use the Arc ini settings for click settings (game restart required on change)
        Fix a very rare crash when too many players are hit by mechanics within 1 game tick

            Picking up demonic tears
            Deimos smash during last 10%
        Add (hopefully) better Deimos oil tracking
            This should not list as many people after the initial person expands the oil. Let me know of any issues / inaccuracies. I haven’t had any deviation from dps.report in my testing
        Disable Dhuum dying on green detection
            This should have been disabled for the last release since it doesn’t work. Oops.
        Fix Xera magic listing the person with magic multiple times
        Add hotkey support for the mechanics log/chart
            By default:
                Alt+Shift+L = Log
                Alt+Shift+N = Chart
            Can be changed in config as decimal (not hex) key codes from here
        Add some additional crash safeguards
        Only show some mechanics in the log to reduce spam
            All are still shown in the chart
            Soon there will be an option per mechanic of what to display where

            Add account name
            Started work for counting the number of boss pulls (currently always 0, will be added soon)
        Add support for loading/saving settings

        Add detection for Dhuum cracks
    December 3 2017
        Remove erroneous Cairn shard reflect logging with new versions of arcdps
        Only show who was afflicted of Dhuum, not who was hit by it (attempt 1)
    December 2 2017
        Add mechanics detection for various Nightmare fotm mechanics
            MAMA
                Flaming wirl
                cone knockback
                giant leap
                standing in acid
                knight’s hammer smash
            Siax
                standing in acid
            Ensolyss
                lunge (being run over)
                smash attack with the 5 adds
        Added mechanics detection for some of Shattered Observatory fotm mechanics
            These skill ids might have changed with some of the various bug fixes to the fractal. If any of these mechanics are not being correctly detected, let me know.
            Arkk
                standing in pie slices
                cone knockback
                exploding a bomb outside a dome
        Added mechanics detection for some raid wing 5 mechanics
            These mechanics are not as fully tested as normal. I wanted to get a release for everyone to try out and hopefully help find any issues with the detection. I believe these all work in some capacity, but for now there might be some errors.
            Horror
                standing in the inner/outer donut
                standing in golem aoe
                standing in pie slices
                touching a scythe
            Dhuum

    November 4 2017
        Add detection for standing in Sabetha cannon fire

        Add MD5 hash
    October 26 2017
        Add Samarog “Bludgeon” detection (Vertical smack during last 33%)
            Special thanks to shootingstar.7160 and [BLCC] (Black Lion Cookie Company) for inspiring the addition of this mechanic
        Re-enable Xera magic detection
            Not fully tested, but it should work now
        Fix potential issue where closing and re-opening the mechanics log would prevent future logging
        Hopefully fix multiple prints for Deimos oils
            It should be good, but let me know of any found inaccuracies
        Use “=” instead of “-” to separate new boss attempts to allow for better/easier filtering
    October 22 2017
        Added gui integration with arcdps
            Enable the mechanics log with the last checkbox in the arcdps options panel (Alt+Shift+T by default)
            The mechanics log can be moved/resized
            Text can be filtered by player name or mechanic
        Partial fix for deimos oil print spaming (the 1st person is the one who activated the oil)
    October 11 2017
        Use new get_init_addr from arcdps combat api (this now requires arcdps from oct.05.2017 or newer)
        Only show 1 person touching a Deimos oil
        Add “————–” between boss attempts
        Show timestamps as min:sec as time since starting combat
